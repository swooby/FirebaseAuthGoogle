# FirebaseAuthGoogle

NOTE: This is a port of https://github.com/alexmamo/FirebaseSignInWithGoogle to work with Wear OS.

Full credit goes to alexmamo and his excellent project where it is due!

I started this project before I found alexmamo's project, thus why this project is stand-alone instead of a fork.

I am also working on a fork of alexmamo's project that I am debating pushing Wear OS changes to,
but I kind of don't want to corrupt alexmamo's project with a fork related to just Wear OS changes.
